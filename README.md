Histogram LKM
============

Histogram is a Linux Kernel Module which provides a histogram of all
words written since the loading of the module.

Histogram works by a registering a keyboard notifier to keep track of
keys pressed. Only ascii characters work during this period.

The histogram is available through a file in debugfs, it contains all
words typed since the loading of the Histogram LKM:
`/sys/kernel/debugfs/histogram/histogram` (Could be accessed in
privileged mode).
